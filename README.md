This project delves into the realm of traffic sign recognition through deep learning methodologies. Leveraging two distinct datasets, namely the German Traffic Sign Recognition Benchmark (GTSRB) and a curated Glare Dataset, we explore the efficacy of three models: RGCN (Recurrent Gated Convolutional Network), a Modified Capsule CNN, and SignV3. Our objective is to scrutinize their performance in accurately identifying traffic signs under various conditions, shedding light on their strengths and limitations in real-world scenarios. Through meticulous experimentation and analysis, we aim to advance the field of intelligent transportation systems for safer and more efficient road navigation.
